# telemetry-server
#Introduction
This is the program that will send telemetry to Logistics Mod servers for analysis and tracking of deliveries. This program is currently not in a state that is working so unless you are interested in contributing to the development, I would not recommend downloading.
#Development Information
If you are interested in contributing to the development of this project, here is a list of the things we still need to do:
* Send collected data to the server
* Add login mechanism
* Change from using embedded code to using the Telemetry library located here: https://github.com/logisticsmod/Ets2-Telemetry-Library
* Store login information in a secure way - most likely using something like this: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xaml/hh465069.aspx
